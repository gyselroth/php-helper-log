Installation
------------

```sh
composer require gyselroth/php-helper-zip
```


### Log-Wrapper

To allow classes of this helper library to log, using the standard logger of the framework used in the rest of 
your application, the library includes ```Gyselroth\Helper\LogWrapper```.
After bootstrapping your application or its service container (if using a framework able of dependency-injection),
the host application's logger can be registered with the Logger-Wrapper (skip this step if you do not use the helper library 
to write any log-entries):

  
#### Usage Example 1: Within Slim PHP application
```php
<?php 
 use Gyselroth\Helper;
 //...
 
 $app = new \Slim\App($settings);

 $container = $app->getContainer();
 
 //...

 $container['logger'] = function (/*...*/) {
     // Callback to PSR-7 logger, e.g. Monolog
     //...
 };
 
 // Register host application's logger component within gyselroth Helper's logger wrapper
 new \Gyselroth\Helper\LoggerWrapper($app->getContainer()['logger']);
```


#### Usage Example 2: Within Zend Framework 1 application

As there's no service container for dependency injection within Zend Framework 1 yet,
the helper classes will by convention draw your logger (probably Zend_Log) from the Zend_Registry

```php
<?php 
 use Gyselroth\Helper\;
 //...
 
 $app = new Zend_Application($env, $config);
 $app->bootstrap();
  
 // Register ZF1 logger class within the helper library's logger-wrapper
 new LoggerWrapper('App_Log');
 
 $app->run();
```
